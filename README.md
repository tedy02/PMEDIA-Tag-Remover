# PMEDIA-Tag-Remover
Searches audio files for PMEDIA's tags and automatically removes them.
Made a simple python script to remove PMEDIA from audio tags. It will search for:
  - www.t.me/pmedia_music
  - P.M.E.D.I.A
  - PMEDIA

Upon launching the script it will ask you for the directory (press enter for the current directory). It will then search that folder and any subfolders it can find. It will display any files that have errors while it comes across them. There is a progress bar that displays but only after the first error from what I can tell. <- would like to improve this.

If you feel this can be improved or something should be changed, please do so. I barely know what I am doing.

*ALSO: If there are any other words they use or any other words that get swamped into tag info that shouldn't be there please leave it in the comments and I see about adding it in.
